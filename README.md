# hugo themes report

Completely rewritten in python, using sqlite for persistent data, and using conditional github api requests to collect the data.
Also, now using sqlalchemy and client-side javascript to interactively filter and sort presentation.

I have the script running on a cron job, if you would like to see [the result](https://trentsonlinedocs.xyz/hugo-themes-report/hugo-themes-report.html).

* reports list of hugo themes, stars, and commit dates
* rank by stars or commit date
* sort by tags so you can compare side by side with the [hugo themes home page](https://themes.gohugo.io/)
* filter by arbitary list of both tags and features
* [hugo themes report](https://trentsonlinedocs.xyz/hugo-themes-report/hugo-themes-report.html)
* [master list of hugo themes](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoThemesSiteBuilder/blob/main/themes.txt)
* [hugo themes home page](https://themes.gohugo.io/)
