# hugo themes report

Completely rewritten in python, using sqlite for persistent data, and using conditional github api requests to collect the data.

I have the script running on a cron job, if you would like to see [the result](https://trentsonlinedocs.xyz/hugo-themes-report/hugo-themes-report.html).

* mobile responsive (somewhat) tables using bootstrap
* reports list of hugo themes, stars, and commit dates
* rank by stars or commit date
* sort by tags so you can compare side by side with the [hugo themes home page](https://themes.gohugo.io/)
* [hugo themes report](https://trentsonlinedocs.xyz/hugo-themes-report/hugo-themes-report.html)
* [master list of hugo themes](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoThemes)
* [hugo themes home page](https://themes.gohugo.io/)
